## An introduction you should read

I write quite a bit, usually in Markdown (see [[Markdown test]] for an example of how to use Markdown syntax), but I usually keep all my markdown files scattered around my hard-drive. Commonplace is a simple wiki-like system to store and browse your markdown files. It works by reading `.md` files from a directory you configure (my advice would be to keep this directory backed up through [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com)). The name draws inspiration from [commonplace books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book).

Commonplace is not meant to be a markdown editor, even though it includes basic editing capabilities. There are a number of tools that do the markdown editing job extremely well - I happen to use [Byword](http://bywordapp.com) for Mac but you get to choose your own poison. If you edit the markdown files in an external editor, changes are reflected here after a refresh.

### Now that you're running this,

If you're seeing this in your browser, it means you got Commonplace installed successfully (The latest instructions [are available here](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace#readme)) and are generally to be considered a master and wizard of installing things. *Good.* What you need to do next is to edit this page to delete my words and to add your own magical works of wordsmithery (which isn't *even a word*, is it?). Then you will be on your way to fame, stardom and more fame<sup>1</sup>. 

I hope Commonplace is as useful to you as it is to me. Let me know ([I'm on twitter](http://twitter.com/f) as the very short letter [@f](http://twitter.com/f)) if you need help or if you have tips on improving it. If you have code chops, feel free to contribute by sending in your pull requests [on Github](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace). 

If you want to contribute financially because you find this to be a neat tool (which makes me quite glad, I'll say), please consider donating 1 dollar per day to [Save the Children](http://www.savethechildren.org/) (or your favorite charity) instead. I'm fortunate enough to be able to do this for free, and there's people who'd make better use of your hard earned money. Thank you! Now start writing, silly reader! *I love you*, miss/sir/intelligent being who happens to understand english.
