## Commonplace introduction

I write a lot, usually in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but I usually keep all my markdown files scattered around my hard-drive. Commonplace is a simple wiki-like system to store and browse markdown files. It works by reading markdown files from a directory you configure (my advice would be to keep this directory backed up through [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com)) and serving those files in HTML. The name comes from [Commonplace books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book).

Commonplace is not meant to be a markdown editor. There are a number of tools that do that job extremely well - I happen to use [Byword](http://bywordapp.com) for Mac but you get to choose your own poison. Changes you do in your editor will reflect upon refresh. For now, consider Commonplace a beautiful way to browse the documents you create using your Markdown editor.

### Now that you're running

If you're seeing this in your browser, it means you got Commonplace installed successfully (The latest instructions [are available here](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace#readme)) and are generally a master and wizard. Good. What you need to do next is wipe your hard disk clean of the drivel you are reading right now and use Commonplace to collect your own magical works of wordsmithery (which isn't even a word). You can find the default `wiki` directory inside your commonplace folder, where this file will be called `home.md`. Edit it, and you're on your way.

I hope this is as useful to you as it is to me. Let me know ([I'm on twitter](http://twitter.com/f) as the very short letter [@f](http://twitter.com/f)) if you need help or if you have tips on improving Commonplace. If you have coding chops, feel free to contribute by sending in your pull requests [on Github](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace). Now start writing, silly reader. I love you.
